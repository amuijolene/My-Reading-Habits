# My-Reading-Habits Analysis

## Project Overview

I analyzed my reading habits for the first six months of 2024. I tracked genres and books read per month, then visualized trends with bar and pie charts. This project showcases my data analysis skills, creativity, and ability to find patterns in personal interests.


## Tools

- MS Excel was used to store data and visualize it
- MS Powerpoint was used to present key findings and insights about my reading habits


## Exploratory Data Analysis Process

Some questions I seeked to answer were:
- Do different book formats (e.g., physical, ebook, audiobook) influence reading speed and time commitment?
- Based on my reading history, what literary genre do I tend to prefer?
- Which countries have authors whose books I tend to rate highly?
  

## Key findings

My study shed light on a few insights. They are: 

- Audio books are easier to finish than pysical books. Audio books offer greater flexibility and accessibility, making them a more convenient format for completing books
- Classic literature is my preferred genre
- Majority of book I read were published by UK authors. I am particularly drawn to the understated and subtle writing style often characteristic of British authors


## Strategic Recommendations

To help dive even deeper into my love for classic literature and UK authors, here are a few tailored tips:

- Try setting a routine to listen to audiobooks during my daily activities, like commuting or exercising
- Mix in both classic and contemporary UK literature to keep things fresh and exciting
- Join a book club focused on other genres. This is because discussing with others can add new layers to my reading experience


## Limitations

One key limitation of this six-month project is the relatively short timeframe to draw definitive conclusions about long-term reading habits. it is challenging to make broad generalizations about my reading habits based on this limited period.
